  - activities: (code, activity); 2 Columns, activities and their associated code
  - features: (n, functions); 2 Columns, Index and associated function
  - x_test: (features); 1 Column, test data results
  - y_test: (code); 1 Column, test labels
  - subject_test: (subject); 1 Column, Subject labels on test data
  - subject_train: (subject); 1 Column, Subject labels on train data
  - x_train: (features); 1 Column, train data results
  - y_train: (features); 1 Column, train data results

Step 1
Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - combine rows with rbind(), rbind(subject_train, subject_test), rbind(x_train, x_test), rbind(y_train, y_test)
  - then combin those three rbind()'s into cbind merging the columns.


Step 2
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - Select columns subject, code, columns that contain 'mean', and columns that contain 'standard deviation' using the Pipe '%>%' command from dplyr library.


Step 3
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - take the activities object and merge it to tidy data object (td)


Step 4
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - rename column name from 'code' to 'activity' 
  - rename "Mag", "Magnitude"
  - rename "-mean()", "Mean"
  - rename "-std()", "STD"
  - rename "Acc", "Accelerometer"
  - rename "^t", "Time"
  - rename "^f", "Frequency"
  - rename "tBody", "TimeBody"
  - rename "BodyBody", "Body"
  - rename "Gyro", "Gyroscope"
  - rename "-freq()", "Frequency"
  - rename "angle", "Angle"
  - rename "gravity", "Gravity"

Step 5
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  -  'NewData.txt' is created and is a tidy dataset.  It summarizes the data by activty.
